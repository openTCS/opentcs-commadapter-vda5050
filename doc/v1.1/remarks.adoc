= General implementation remarks

* Unfortunately, the VDA5050 1.1 specification documents that can be found at https://github.com/vda5050 (both the specification itself as well as the JSON schemas) deviate from the official specification PDF document in some places.
  The openTCS driver is implemented based on the VDA5050 1.1 PDF document as the definitive specification.
* Section 6.1.3 of the VDA5050 1.1 specification states that enumeration elements are to be written in uppercase.
  On the other hand, the specification lists camel-cased enumeration elements in some places (e.g. `autoAck` instead of `AUTOACK`).
  The openTCS driver sticks to the rule of all enumeration elements being kept in uppercase.
* Section 6.2 of the VDA5050 1.1 specification states that a Quality-of-Service (QoS) level of 0 (_at most once_) is to be used for all communication.
  For the `connection` topic, this makes communication of critical information unreliable, and with VDA5050 2.0, a QoS level of 1 (_at least once_) is specified for this topic.
  For this reason, the openTCS driver subscribes to the `connection` topic with a QoS level of 1, and vehicles are expected to publish to it with a QoS level of 1, too.
* A message from the vehicle may be ignored in the following cases:
** If the vehicle's `connection` topic indicates that the vehicle is offline.
** If the message is considered outdated, i.e. it contains a timestamp that is older than the last accepted message on the same topic.
* In case the vehicle rejects an order, the openTCS driver does not send further messages to it.
  Before any new messages can be sent to the vehicle, it is necessary to (forcibly) withdraw the vehicle's current transport order in openTCS.
  For details regarding order rejection, see the 'order' topic reference in xref:runtime-behaviour.adoc#topic-order[].
* The vehicle is expected to reflect every instant action in its `actionStates` list.
  Not doing so effectively leads to the driver repeating the instant action message infinitely, blocking all other order or instant action messages.
  For details regarding instant actions, see the 'instantActions' topic reference in xref:runtime-behaviour.adoc#topic-instantactions[].
