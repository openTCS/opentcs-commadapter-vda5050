= Driver usage and configuration

To make use of the driver, some configuration data needs to be made available to it as part of the kernel's configuration files or as plant model elements or transport orders.

== Configuration file entries

All of the following entries need to be set to valid values in the kernel application's configuration files for the vehicle driver to function correctly:

`commadapter.vehicle.vda5050.enabledVersions`::
Set to a list of VDA5050 specification versions for which to enable the vehicle driver; set to an empty string to disable it.
When disabled, the kernel will not use the driver at all, even if vehicles are configured for it.
Valid versions to be used here are: `1.1`, `2.0`.
`commadapter.vehicle.vda5050.onOpModeChangeDoUpdateIntegrationLevel`::
Set to a map of VDA5050 operating mode names to openTCS integration level names.
Whenever the vehicle's reported operating mode changes to a value given in the map, the vehicle's integration level in openTCS will be changed to the one given for that operating mode.
Valid values for operating mode names are `TEACHIN`, `SERVICE`, `MANUAL`, `SEMIAUTOMATIC` and `AUTOMATIC`.
Valid values for integration level names are `TO_BE_UTILIZED`, `TO_BE_RESPECTED`, `TO_BE_NOTICED`, `TO_BE_IGNORED`; the value `LEAVE_UNCHANGED`, which is the default for every operating mode, can be used to explicitly state that the integration level should not be changed. +
+
Note that for setting a vehicle's integration level to `TO_BE_NOTICED` or `TO_BE_IGNORED`, openTCS requires the vehicle to not be processing any transport order, so it usually makes sense to also configure the driver to explicitly withdraw any transport order in these cases.
(See below.)
`commadapter.vehicle.vda5050.onOpModeChangeDoWithdrawOrder`::
Set to a map of VDA5050 operating mode names to boolean values.
Whenever the vehicle's reported operating mode changes to a value given in the map, the vehicle's transport order may be withdrawn; if it is withdrawn, this happens forcibly.
Valid values for operating mode names are `TEACHIN`, `SERVICE`, `MANUAL`, `SEMIAUTOMATIC` and `AUTOMATIC`.
Valid assignment values are `true` (do withdraw the transport order forcibly) and `false` (do not withdraw the transport order), with `false` being the default for every operating mode.
`commadapter.vehicle.vda5050.onOpModeChangeDoResetPosition`::
Set to a map of VDA5050 operating mode names to boolean values.
Whenever the vehicle's reported operating mode changes to a value given in the map, the vehicle's last known position may be reset.
Valid values for operating mode names are `TEACHIN`, `SERVICE`, `MANUAL`, `SEMIAUTOMATIC` and `AUTOMATIC`.
Valid assignment values are 'true' (do reset the last known position) and 'false' (do not reset the last known position), with 'false' being the default for every operating mode.
`commadapter.vehicle.vda5050.mqtt.brokerHost`::
The IP address or host name of the MQTT broker to be used.
`commadapter.vehicle.vda5050.mqtt.brokerPort`::
The port number of the MQTT broker to be used.
`commadapter.vehicle.vda5050.mqtt.connectionEncrypted`::
Whether to use SSL/TLS encryption for the connection to the MQTT borker.
Valid values are `true` and `false`.
Note that, for an encrypted connection, the server's certificate must be signed by a CA certificate trusted by the system the driver is running on.
`commadapter.vehicle.vda5050.mqtt.username`::
The user name to be used for authenticating with the MQTT broker.
May be set to an arbitrary value in case no authentication is required with the broker.
`commadapter.vehicle.vda5050.mqtt.password`::
The password to be used for authenticating with the MQTT broker.
May be set to an arbitrary value in case no authentication is required with the broker.
`commadapter.vehicle.vda5050.mqtt.clientId`::
The client ID to use for the connection to the MQTT broker.
This should be unique among all clients connecting to the broker.
`commadapter.vehicle.vda5050.mqtt.keepAliveInterval`::
The keep-alive interval (in ms) for the connection to the MQTT broker.
Can be set to zero to disable the keep-alive mechanism.
Will be rounded down to seconds if non-zero.
`commadapter.vehicle.vda5050.mqtt.reconnectInterval`::
The interval (in ms) for trying to reconnect to the MQTT broker.

The following example configuration can be used as a template to be pasted into the kernel configuration file and adjusted for the respective plant:
