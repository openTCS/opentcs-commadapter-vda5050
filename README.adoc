= VDA5050 communication adapter for openTCS

This https://www.opentcs.org/[openTCS] vehicle communication adapter implements the VDA5050 protocol specification versions 1.1 and 2.0, using JSON messages via MQTT.
(_openTCS vehicle communication adapter_ means it implements the interface on the openTCS side.
If you are looking for an open-source library that helps you use VDA5050 on the vehicle side, check e.g. https://git.openlogisticsfoundation.org/silicon-economy/libraries/vda5050/libvda5050pp[libVDA5050++], instead.)

== How to use this driver

To be able to use this driver, its JAR file needs to be on the Java classpath of both the openTCS Kernel application as well as the Kernel Control Center application.
Optionally you can also add it to the classpath of the Model Editor application for property key/value suggestions.

The artifact is published via Maven Central.
In your openTCS integration project, add the following dependency to the `build.gradle` file with the respective application's subproject, replacing `<VERSION>` with the appropriate driver version number:

[source,groovy]
----
implementation 'org.opentcs.commadapter.vehicle.vda5050:opentcs-commadapter-vda5050:<VERSION>'
----

=== Configuration

To make use of the driver, some configuration data needs to be made available to it as part of the kernel's configuration files or as plant model elements or transport orders.
Common configuration required for all VDA5050 specification versions is described in the following documents:

* link:./doc/configuration.adoc[Common configuration]

To use the driver with specific versions of the VDA5050 specification, the following documentation applies:

* VDA5050 1.1:
** link:./doc/v1.1/configuration.adoc[Configuration]
** link:./doc/v1.1/runtime-behaviour.adoc[Runtime behaviour]
** link:./doc/v1.1/remarks.adoc[General implementation remarks]
* VDA5050 2.0:
** link:./doc/v2.0/configuration.adoc[Configuration]
** link:./doc/v2.0/runtime-behaviour.adoc[Runtime behaviour]
** link:./doc/v2.0/remarks.adoc[General implementation remarks]
